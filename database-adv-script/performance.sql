/* Step 1 — Initial (unoptimized) query
   Notes:
   - SELECT * pulls wide text columns unnecessarily
   - No explicit ordering/pagination
   - Uses INNER JOIN to Payment (drops unpaid bookings)
   - Ambiguous column names (hard to read / maintain)*/
-- initial BASELINE query
SELECT
  *
FROM Booking b
JOIN `User` u
  ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p
  ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN Payment pay
  ON pay.booking_id = b.booking_id;
     AND pay.payment_id IS NOT NULL;


/*Step 2 — EXPLAIN baseline */

JOIN `User` u
  ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p
  ON b.property_id = p.property_id

/* Step 3 — Refactored (optimized) query
   Improvements:
   - Project only needed columns (avoids wide rows)
   - LEFT JOIN Payment to keep unpaid bookings
   - Stable ORDER BY for deterministic results
   - Optional WHERE/LIMIT for paging (uncomment as needed)
   - Works well with indexes created in database_index.sql:
       Booking(user_id), Booking(property_id),
       Payment(booking_id), Property(host_id), etc. */
